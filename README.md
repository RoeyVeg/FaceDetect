# Face Recognition App - a single-page web app with REST API backend
A cool APP based on Calrify API - Face Detection model, the user sign in and upload a face image, the model detects the face (yes it really works :) ) and frame the face with a box shape, the user is ranked for every picture he/she uploads to the site, simulating a model training.
The APP includes both Frontend - REACT and Backend - Node.js and PostgreSQL DB
Frontend featuring a beautiful particles background (particles.js) and styled with tachyons.
Backend, using npm's: express, bodyParser, cors, bcrypt and knex, with 3 main endpoints: 
1. register user details & hashing users passwords
2. Signin 
3. Load image and keeping track of rank
